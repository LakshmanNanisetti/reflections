What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When a git repository is initialized a .git file is created it contains all the metadata about the repository. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Working directory is the current folder in which we are working.
	Repository is a directory that has gitmetadata that is a directory along with .git file which is created by git init command.
	Staging area contains the files that we want to commit.
